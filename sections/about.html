                    I'm a <strong>Senior Data Engineer</strong> and <strong>MBCS member</strong> who thrives on building data systems that actually make a difference.

                <p>
                    My career has taken me across a diverse landscape: from shaping national education data at the <strong>Department for Education</strong>, to consulting at <strong>KPMG UK</strong>, scaling enterprise solutions at <strong>Experian</strong>, and driving innovation at fast-moving startups like <strong>IDenteq</strong>. This breadth of experience across government, Big 4 consulting, and the startup world gives me a unique perspective on solving data challenges at any scale.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond my day job, I'm passionate about giving back to the tech community. I volunteer my time mentoring aspiring engineers and recently served as a <strong>judge for the UK IT Awards 2025</strong>. I believe in building not just great data systems, but a stronger, more inclusive tech industry.
