        I am Youssef Hassan, a dedicated Data Engineer with a passion for automating data solutions and building efficient data pipelines. 
        With a strong foundation in Python, SQL, and Powershell, I specialise in leveraging cloud technologies like AWS, Azure, and Databricks 
        to optimise data processing and storage solutions.

        My professional journey includes significant experience in migrating to Databricks at the Department for Education and optimising cloud infrastructure 
        at IDenteq Ltd using AWS services. I'm deeply involved in digital transformation initiatives, ensuring organisations can make data-driven decisions.
